### What is [VoltBot](https://voltbot.xyz)?

**[VoltBot](https://voltbot.xyz)** is a robot with two languages, **French** and **English**, which aims to **compete** with the **discord bots**. It is above all a bot of **moderation**, **security** and with **interesting features**.

### Why this idea?

We always wanted to **compete** with the **discord robots**. It was a **challenge for us**, to have **one of the most glorious robots**. The fact that **everyone wants to develop to have their [developer badge certified](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040720412)**, has given us even more the **desire to finish our waiting**. Our infrastructure is capable of **making use of a multitude of things in a precise time**.

### When did we start?

We started the creation last **August 2019**, with all **the development** of our infrastructure. Despite a multitude of past hours, days or weeks, our infrastructure is nomadic depending on where it is launched and, it is **optimized** which greatly **reduces the latencies** of the server.

### Where is it launched?

It is launched on a machine with
* **10x** E5-2680-V2 (at 3.50 Ghz)
* **64**Gb of RAM
* **250**Gb of SSD 
* **1**Gbp/s download
* **6**ms ping with [Google](https://google.com) and ~**10**ms with [Discord](https://discord.com), *itâ€™s beautiful ðŸ˜Ž*

### Who is its creator?
Itâ€™s actually **me**, **the one** who writes **this description**, **[Freiik](https://freiik.com)**. I designed from **A** *to* **Z [VoltBot](https://voltbot.xyz)** and **recruited qualified developers** who help me regularly.

### What language was it developed in?
It's developed in **[NodeJS](https://node.js.org)**, with the [**Discord.js API**](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). We have **additional modules** built into **[NodeJS](https://node.js.org)** but that I donâ€™t think are **important**.

### Nice but, how do we use it on our servers?
It's simple, the **prefix** on the server is basically **";"**, but is the **prefix** is **not there**, you can **mention** the **bot** and he **respond** with **the prefix on the server**.

### What is the bot link?
